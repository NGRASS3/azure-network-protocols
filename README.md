<h1>Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Inspecting Traffic Between Azure Virtual Machines</h1>
In this tutorial, we observe various network traffic to and from Azure Virtual Machines with Wireshark as well as experiment with Network Security Groups. <br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Various Network Protocols (SSH, RDH, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP)
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 20.04

<h2>High-Level Steps</h2>

- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3
- Step 4

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p>
First we will create two Virtual Machines on Azure. One machine will be a Linux machine and the other will be a Windows 10 machine. Both will have two cpus and they must be on the same VNET. Below is a shot of the Network Topology.
